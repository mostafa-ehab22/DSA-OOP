# DSA & OOP Learning Resources

Welcome to my personal repository for learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This repo serves as a central place for my study material where it's a collection of my notes, code examples and practice problems to help me master these fundamental concepts.

## Overview

- [Mind Map](https://coggle.it/diagram/W5u8QkZs6r4sZM3J/t/master-the-interview)
- Detailed notes on key concepts.
- Code examples demonstrating implementation.
- Practice problems to reinforce understanding.
- Review "Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms".

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a solid understanding of common algorithms and data structures.
- Master object-oriented programming principles and design patterns.
- Apply theoretical knowledge through practical coding problems.
